# Rollercoaster
Python application for rollercoaster users.
This is a simple python application which tells its user who can ride a rollercoaster based on the height and age provided. It also tells them how much they need to pay for the ride.
Once the user runs the application, they are welcomed then an input function asks for their height in cms.
If the height is greater than or equal to 120, then the get the response saying they can ride the roller coaster.
Another input function prompts them to provide their age. 
If their age is less than or equal to 12, they will get a response saying their fee will be $10
Else if their age is less than or equal to they get a reponse saying their fee will be $15
Else if their age is greater than or equal to 60, they get a response saying their fee will be $15
Otherwise, if they do not fall into any of these age brackets, they need to pay $20 as fee.
In the case where a users height is less than 120cm,they are told that they can not ride the rollercoaster and have to grow taller to ride it.
